Step 3: X11 Configuration (for multiple screens)
To manage both HDMI outputs independently, X11 needs to treat them as separate displays:

Check Display Names: After rebooting, check the display identifiers using:

bash
Copy code
xrandr
You should see something like HDMI-1 and HDMI-2.

Create X11 Configuration File: Create a new Xorg configuration file to handle the screens separately.

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
Add the Following Configuration:

ini
Copy code
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "HDMI-1"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "HDMI-2"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Screen0"
    Device "HDMI-1"
    Monitor "HDMI-1"
    DefaultDepth 24
    SubSection "Display"
        Depth 24
        Modes "1920x1080"  # Adjust to your resolution
    EndSubSection
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Screen1"
    Device "HDMI-2"
    Monitor "HDMI-2"
    DefaultDepth 24
    SubSection "Display"
        Depth 24
        Modes "1920x1080"
    EndSubSection
EndSection
Save the file and reboot again:

bash
Copy code
sudo reboot
